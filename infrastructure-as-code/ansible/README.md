Needed to add ssh pub file to ssh agent to ssh, https://stackoverflow.com/a/51500802.

## Ansible vault

Add Ansible vault password as ENV variable, `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE=<path-to-file>`. 
I had to run file as bash script for it to work.
```
#!/bin/bash
cat <<EOF
<password>
EOF
```

## Dynamic inventory for AWS
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#inventory-script-example-aws-ec2

## AWS credentials

Use `insert_aws_keys_in_config.sh` to paste AWS credentials from clipboard into `aws_keys.yml`.



## ansible.cfg

Config for ansible.
Example of relevant settings:
```
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
private_key_file = <path-to-ssh-pub-file>
ansible_python_interpreter = ../../.venv/bin/python

[inventory]
enable_plugins = ini
```

Needed the following for Ansible to read the `hosts` file (which parser it should use to read the file).
```
[inventory]
enable_plugins = ini
```

To be able to run commands locally using venv, the following is needed.
```
ansible_python_interpreter = ../../.venv/bin/python
```

Problems with ssh and ControlSocket/permission denied for cp/ssh, https://stackoverflow.com/a/41698903.

```
[ssh_connection]
ssh_args =
```


## Run locally

When we want to work against an API, as the AWS modules do, we don't want Ansible to SSH to any server. So we connect to localhost without an ssh connection.
In `hosts` we need:
```
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
```
In the playbook:
```
-   hosts: local
    connection: local # Keep ansible from open ssh connection
    gather_facts: False
```
